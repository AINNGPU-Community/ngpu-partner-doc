API Integration for Compute Power Demand Side
=======
* When using AINNGPU for API integration, the compute power demand side needs to provide their workspace (a Docker image encapsulating their own AI capabilities). AINNGPU will deploy this Docker image across multiple nodes and make intelligent node selections. Since AINNGPU employs a parameter pass-through method, the following steps can be used during API integration.
-----------

# Integration Steps

+ The compute power demand side provides their runnable Docker image, including the Docker image's startup commands.
+ The compute power demand side provides the type and number of GPUs required.
+ The compute power demand side provides the Docker-supported APIs (AINNGPU will use a pass-through mode for API parameter data transmission).

# Example of API Integration

## Synchronous Mode

### Task Request

#### Original API Interface

* Protocol Type: POST
* Protocol Address: https://***/img2img
* Request Body
```shell
{
    "image_url": "https://ainngpu.io/image/1683730315image.jpeg",
    "prompt": "manicured claws, score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, score_5_up, score_4_up, 1girl, realistic, extremely detailed, high quality, , beautiful eyes, cat woman, black suit, character concept,night time, dark shadows, dutch angle"
}
```
* Response Body
```shell
{
	"result_code": 100,
	"msg": "SUCCESS! The video is currently in the queue waiting to be processed",
    "image_url": "https://ainngpu.io/image/16837303689.jpeg"
}
```

#### Post-Integration API Interface
* Protocol Type: POST
* Protocol Address: https://ainngpu.io/user/img2img
* Request Body
```shell
{
    "btc_address": "bc1pp8vyhh2ma0ntzjwr26xxrn5r0w296yu68wdwle5rrhgtv3a2lgkqtyayus",
    "data": ""
}
```
Field Name | Field Type | Field Meaning
----|:----:|:----:|
btc_address|string|Optional user's BTC address (checks for AINN assets if provided, skips if empty)
data|string|Data content for pass-through (can retain original API request body)


* Response Body
```shell
{
	"result_code": 100,
	"msg": "SUCCESS! The video is currently in the queue waiting to be processed",
    "data": ""
}
```
Field Name | Field Type | Field Meaning
----|:----:|:----:|
result_code|string|Optional user's BTC address (checks for AINN assets if provided, skips if empty)
msg|string|Message content
data|string|Task result (using pass-through, includes original API response body)


## Asynchronous Mode
-----------
* Differences between synchronous and asynchronous modes lie in that the asynchronous mode provides a taskID upon submitting the task request. The taskID is then periodically checked to see if the task has been completed.
